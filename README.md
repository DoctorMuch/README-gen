  # The ReadMe Generation

  
  ### Description
  This application helps take some of the headache out of writing a README.md file by giving prompts for a developer to answer. The developer's answers then populate essential fields for a good ReadMe file, including the title, contact information, repository information and links, license, installation, and usage nformation.

  ### Installation
  The user needs to install the inquirer package with npm install on first use. To start the application, one simply needs to key node index.js

  ---
  ### Usage
  This application is intended to build out a basic framework for a high-quality ReadMe file. Additional information, such as screenshots are better implemented using a GUI, where the developer has easier access to a wider range of files. But this app allows for a quick build out of important elements.
